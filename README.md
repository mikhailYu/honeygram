## Honeygram

Honeygram is a social media app for bears inspired by Instagram.

Users are able to create posts, upload images and interact with other users' posts. Everyone has their own profile page that displays their content as well as the amount of followers they have and how many others they follow.

A variety of default icons are provided if the user chooses to not upload one themselves but the option is still there to do so. Authentication is done through email and password and all of the data is stored and sorted on a Firebase database.

I hope you enjoy!
